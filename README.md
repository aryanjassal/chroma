# Chroma

Use a single command to theme your entire system.

Why does this exist, you ask? I wasn't happy with how other theming applications worked. Granted, "other" means only three applications: [Gradience](https://github.com/GradienceTeam/Gradience), [Pywal](https://github.com/dylanaraps/pywal), and [Chameleon](https://github.com/GideonWolfe/Chameleon). I know two of those applications are archived, and the third one relies on one of the archived application. But still. I don't like that.

And, what started off as a simple script to take in a lua file theme file and write it to some set applications' configuration became this. It's like you were trying to build a sand castle on the beach, but you somehow end up building Rome within a day. Crazy things.

## Installation

To launch Chroma in development mode, simply enter a `nix develop` shell. It will automatically install it locally in edit mode, allowing you to test out or edit the program while retaining access to the command itself.

```console
[aryanj@laptop:~]$ git clone https://github.com/aryanjassal/chroma.git
Cloning into 'chroma'...
remote: Enumerating objects: 58, done.
remote: Counting objects: 100% (58/58), done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (35/35), done.
remote: Total 58 (delta 22), reused 49 (delta 16), pack-reused 0 (from 0)
Receiving objects: 100% (58/58), 31.91 KiB | 1.68 MiB/s, done.
Resolving deltas: 100% (22/22), done.

[aryanj@laptop:~]$ cd chroma

[aryanj@laptop:~/chroma]$ nix develop
```

Currently, Chroma is well-supported in Nix. To install for Nix, update home manager's flake file to have Chroma as an input, and add the following as a package (assuming you have `inputs` and `system` passed through from the flake to the actual module). Currently, a home manager module **does not exist**, but it is planned.

```nix
home.packages = [
    ...
    inputs.chroma.packages.${system}.default
    ...
]
```

For other, _normal_ distros with mutable filesystem, simply install this into your system-wide `pip` installation after cloning the repository. Almost all distros now disallow directly interacting with the system-wide python environment because you can break things. But I haven't released an actual package to PyPi or other package registries yet, so this is the only way for regular distros to gain access to this command.

```console
[aryanj@laptop:~]$ git clone https://github.com/aryanjassal/chroma.git
Cloning into 'chroma'...
remote: Enumerating objects: 58, done.
remote: Counting objects: 100% (58/58), done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (35/35), done.
remote: Total 58 (delta 22), reused 49 (delta 16), pack-reused 0 (from 0)
Receiving objects: 100% (58/58), 31.91 KiB | 1.68 MiB/s, done.
Resolving deltas: 100% (22/22), done.

[aryanj@laptop:~]$ cd chroma

[aryanj@laptop:~/chroma]$ pip install .
```

I personally don't use normal distros, so I can't really test this out myself. If someone has an issue, post it up. Even better if someone has a solution!

## Usage

Chroma is a command line tool. This means that you must interact with the _terminal_ (oo, scary!).

To load a theme, simply run the following command. It will load a theme at the given location, and print out a bunch of logs. By default, currently, it prints out everything including debug logs. Verbosity flags will be added in the future.

```console
[aryanj@laptop:~]$ chroma load path/to/theme.lua [--override path/to/override.lua]
```

That's it! This will load the theme and run it through the handlers. If the target file already exists, the handler will attempt to back up the file automatically. If the backup fails, then you would have to manually back the file up. Chroma checks if a particular header exists in the file. If it does, that means that the file was generated by Chroma, and it can freely edit/modify the file.

In case the header changes in the future, all the old themes would need to be removed. Most likely a command will exist at that time, which will iterate over the theme and remove all output files generated by Chroma.

To generate colors from an image (it will usually be your wallpaper) and apply that as your new color palette, you can use this command to do so. Remember, however, that the colors this command generates aren't always the best, and if you solely rely on this, you might end up with weird theme or artifacts. This option is currently under heavy development, so you need to specify the `--experimental` flag to use this feature anyways.

```console
[aryanj@laptop:~]$ chroma generate --experimental path/to/image.img [--output path/to/generated/theme.lua] [--override path/to/override.lua]
```

This command will automatically generate a lua theme file with your wallpaper and save it to the desired path (the cache directory by default). The command will not generate any metadata or anything fancy. These are just plain colors and themes. Also, make sure that you have `imagemagick` installed on your system before you run the generation command. It is already present for Nix users in both the development shell and after building if installed as a program.

I will try my best to help with issues regarding dynamic color generation, but expect it to take a while before its stable enough to be used properly.

## Theming

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To theme GTK apps, please install the `adw-gtk3` theme from [here](https://github.com/lassekongo83/adw-gtk3). It makes GTK theming life much much easier than it would have been otherwise.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> GTK is known for not being friendly to theming. As such, no formal API for theming is exposed. This means that, while many apps will be themed, many will still remain unthemed or in a broken state. Some cases will be impossible to resolve, but some might be oversights/mistakes. If you see one such issue, then raise an issue for that.
> Other handlers also might have similar issues, as you might use features which I never use, so I never implemented theming for it. If such cases arise, feel free to raise an issue about it. If you get a custom handler working which fixes an issue you have, make a pull request with your changes. This will ensure everyone else will also be absolved of their frustrations!

```lua
-- Define a table for storing theme groups. Each group is the application name
-- with a table assigned to it. It can store tables. The color scheme is one
-- such table (see below for an example).
-- Note that you should import the default table when writing your own themes.
-- This would ensure that any fields you haven't filled in will be set to a
-- default value. This is not necessary as the options are merged with the
-- default table anyways (see `theme.options` below), but you might get
-- hard to debug bugs without this, so its good practice to include it.
-- Here, we also include `python`. It is an empty table whose sole purpose is
-- to silence LSP errors when using `python.none` to signify a `None` value
-- to the Python backend. Otherwise, a bunch of warnings will be generated
-- and I hate that. If you don't need to use `python.none`, just don't include
-- it.
local theme = require "chroma.bultins.default"

-- These options control the behaviour of theme generation. Know what you are
-- doing before chaging any option here, as you most likely don't want to be

theme.options = {
  -- This specifies the Chroma version for which the theme was written for. If
  -- the theme is designed for a different version of Chroma, then Chroma will

  -- applying the theme. Must be defined like: "1.0.0" where there are three
  -- numbers separated by two periods. See https://semver.org/.
  chroma_version = "1.0.0",

  -- By default, the theme generator merges the table with the default table.
  -- This ensures doing something like this:
  -- [[ themes.gtk { colors = { red = "#ff0000", } } ]]

-- Of course we need metadata.
theme.meta = {
  -- These fields are the metadata of the actual theme. They need to be filled
  -- out manually, but the fields are optional. Note that we have two version
  -- fields, `chroma_version` and `version`. The `chroma_version` field is the
  -- important one as that impacts the behaviour of Chroma based on the expected

  spaced = {
    -- Of course, as usual, you can set and override colors as needed. All
    -- key-value pairs from the `colors` table will be output in the file
    -- following the right formating rules. No error-checking or type safety
    -- checks are done here, so you are on your own.
    colors = colors,

    -- are defined by putting their names inside {}. For example, this format will

    -- white #ffffff
    -- black #000000
    -- Available variables are:
    -- {name}: Color name (no spaces allowed)
    -- {hex}: Hexadecimal color value (with leading hashtag)
    -- {hexval}: Hexadecimal color value (without leading hashtag)
    format = "{name} {hex}",

    -- This format works similar to the color definition format, but instead,
    -- this works on the header instead. The header tells Chroma if the file
    -- was generated by the user (which we should back up), or by Chroma itself
    -- (which it will overwrite without backups). The header format is
    -- provided to ensure that the header will be formatted as a comment for
    -- the file we are writing to.
    -- Available variables are:
    -- {header}: The header template, provided by Chroma
    -- Set this to `nil` or `python.none` to not generate or check for a header.
    -- This is not recommended.
    header = "# {header}"

    -- You can also expand all environment variables available to the program
    -- like in the shell. DO NOT OVERWRITE THE SAME FILE AGAIN! Lua is
    -- intrinsically random with table order, so it is undefined behaviour to
    -- replace the same file!
    out = "~/cache/chroma/colors.col",
  },

  -- Similarly, another handler for sass colors is also provided to get the hang of
  -- the formatting.
  scss = {
    colors = colors,
    out = "~/cache/chroma/_colors.scss",
    header = "// {header}"

    -- This format will result in the following output:
    -- $white: #ffffff;
    -- $black: #000000;
    format = "${name}: {hex};",
  },
}

-- You need to return the theme table at the end. Without this, Chroma can't see
-- any theme data.
return theme
```

## Overrides

We can create themes, sure. But, what if I have my configuration files saved somewhere else? Or you want particular colors in GTK's palette 5? This is where the overrides come into play. All you need to do is create `~/.config/chroma/overrides.lua` and populate it with the overrides you want. Note that you need to reference the current theme to override its options. This override file, if existing, will apply overrides to every loaded theme.

```lua
-- ~/.config/chroma/overrides.lua

-- Note the different require clause to import current theme. Python can also
-- be imported here from builtins.
local theme = require("chroma.themes.current")
local python = require("chroma.builtins.python")

-- The override table is merged with the themes table. This ensures only the
-- overridden values are updated, and other values are untouched.
theme.kitty = {
  out = "~/.config/kitty/themes/" .. theme.meta.name .. '.conf'
}

-- Of course, we still need to return the theme so Chroma can read the theme data.
return theme
```

## Custom Handlers

You can make custom integrations by making your own handler. Each handler must be inside `chroma/handlers`. Each handler is a Python file which must expose a `apply()` method. The `apply()` method should take in two variables: `group` and `meta`. The group will contain the group options, like `colors`, `out`, etc. and will be probably used the most. The `meta` field will have any relevant set metadata like the theme name, author, etc. which could be useful in embedding the metadata directly into the generated theme file.

Of course, this is only for development. To create a local handler which can be discovered, create this handler inside `~/.config/chroma/handlers` as a python file. It needs to provide a function with signature `apply(group, meta)`. Otherwise, the `apply()` function is malformed and will be flagged as such. Take a look at the following minimum example for a handler. Of course, you should make it more featureful and informative, which would eventually come and help you in the future.

> [!NOTE]
> This works, but is still kind of experimental. Expect bugs or changes to the behaviour. Further testing is required. Feel free to provide feedback.

> [!WARNING]
> Custom handlers are just any regular python scripts. They can do malicious things. Make sure you trust the source of the handler, and that the contents of the handler seem valid.

```py
# ~/.config/chroma/handlers/my_handler.py

from chroma.logger import Logger

logger = Logger.get_logger()

def apply(group, meta):
    logger.info("Greetings from this custom handler!")
```

This might give a warning that Chroma doesn't exist as a library. Worry not, as when Chroma executes the handler, it will be able to detect and provide the `chroma` module. This just happens due to Nix's strict isolation policies. To fix this issue, include Chroma in the devshell's `buildInputs`. This will allow python to detect the library and get rid of those pesky and annoying warnings.

## Roadmap

> [!IMPORTANT]
> User-defined handlers are no longer experimental. However, exercise caution when downloading custom handlers as they can run arbitrary code on your system.

- Make palette generation via images stable
  - Split generators into frontend and backend
  - Get proper color values from image by doing HLS colorspace magic
- Provide preset themes for quicker start with system theming (in progress)
  - Make user defined themes directory
  - Registry for theme names to parsed theme
  - Themes are expected to export a `colors` table by default
  - Editing existing theme by requiring theme
    - Change imports
      - Merge namespace for themes (`chroma.themes` will include both user themes and builtin themes)
      - If not possible, then move user config to `chroma.user` namespace
- Clean up and update `Colors` to be more streamlined
    - Replace `Colors.to(fmt)` to `Colors.as_rgb()` and similar syntax
    - Replace `Colors.convert(fmt)` to `Colors.copy(fmt)`
    - Add utility to guess color type using regexes
        - Support RGB and HLS formatting in lua (needs `chroma.lib.colors`)
- Update handlers to rely on `Color` more heavily
- Create a handler registry, mapping each handler to an application implementation
- Make icon (inspired by Prism Launcher)
- Allow custom variable substitution for paths (or just use regular path substitution for that)
- Add upstream metadata field
    - Allow themes to be updated by a command, replacing local with remote content
- Add a `handle = false` field on handler table to disable handling
- Add `chroma.lib` for utility functions within lua
    - Add `Color` class and conversion utilities for lua
    - By default, all colors should be `Color` objects
- Make lua handlers more powerful
    - Add pre and post inserts for the files
    - Add support for template files
    - Add/update documentation

## Notes

I have been trying to inject the default theme table into lua's system path, so theme developers can get type hints. Applications like `vim` (kind of) do it, so it should be possible. I just can't figure out how to do it. If anyone does, you're welcome to contribute. Rather, _please_ contribute.

I want to add a GUI to go with Chroma, but I don't have time to make the whole thing by myself in a reasonable time frame. If anyone wants to contribute, then feel free to step up and take over the development.
