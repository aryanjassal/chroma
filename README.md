# Chroma

Use a single command to theme your entire system.

## Installation

I'm still figuring out an elegant way to install this as a system package. For now, make a virtual environment in root directory, and install it in the virtual environment.

```console
[aryanj@laptop:~]$ git clone https://github.com/aryanjassal/chroma.git

[aryanj@laptop:~]$ cd chroma

[aryanj@laptop:~/chroma]$ source venv/bin/activate

[aryanj@laptop:~/chroma]$ pip install -e .
```

## Usage

Chroma is a command line tool. This means that you must interact with the *terminal* (oo, scary!).

To load a theme, simply run the following command. It will load a theme at the given location, and print out a bunch of logs. By default, currently, it prints out everything including debug logs. Verbosity flags will be added in the future.

```console
[aryanj@laptop:~]$ chroma load path/to/theme.lua
```

That's it! This will load the theme and run it through the handlers. If the target file already exists, the handler will attempt to back up the file automatically. If the backup fails, then you would have to manually back the file up. Chroma checks if a particular header exists in the file. If it does, that means that the file was generated by Chroma, and it can freely edit/modify the file.

In case the header changes in the future, all the old themes would need to be removed. Most likely a command will exist at that time, which will iterate over the theme and remove all output files generated by Chroma.

## Theming

```lua
-- Define a table for storing theme groups. Each group is the application name
-- with a table assigned to it. It can store tables. The color scheme is one
-- such table (see below for an example).
-- Note that you should import the default table when writing your own themes.
-- This would ensure that any fields you haven't filled in will be set to a
-- default value. This is not necessary as the options are merged with the
-- default table anyways (see `theme.options` below), but you might get
-- hard to debug bugs without this, so its good practice to include it.
local theme = require("chroma.builtins.default")

-- These options control the behaviour of theme generation. Know what you are
-- doing before chaging any option here.
theme.options = {
	-- By default, the theme generator merges the table with the default table.
	-- This ensures doing something like this:
	-- [[ themes.gtk { colors = { red = "#ff0000", } } ]]
	-- Would not result in other values being nil. To disable this behaviour, set
	-- this flag to false.
	merge_tables = true,
}

-- Of course we need a metadata table.
theme.meta = {
	-- This specifies the Chroma version for which the theme was written for. If
	-- the theme is designed for a different version of Chroma, then Chroma will
	-- give you a warning. Most likely, older theme versions will just crash while
	-- applying the theme. Must be defined like: "1.0.0" where there are three
	-- numbers separated by two periods. See https://semver.org/.
    chroma_version = "0.0.1",

	-- These fields are the metadata of the actual theme. They need to be filled
	-- out manually, but the fields are optional.
	name = "unset",
	description = "unset",
	author = "unset",
	version = "unset",
	url = "unset",
}

-- You can also extend this by defining custom colors. Any additional colours
-- defined in theme groups will be passed to theme handlers.
local colors = {
	black = "#000000",
	red = "#ff0000",
	green = "#00ff00",
	yellow = "#ffff00",
	blue = "#0000ff",
	magenta = "#ff00ff",
	cyan = "#00ffff",
	white = "#ffffff",
}

-- You can also define variables. Note that any defined variables or functions
-- will be discarded, and only the values in the returned table will be
-- processed.
local foreground = colors.white
local background = colors.black
local gtk_defaultpalette = {
	blue = nil,
	green = nil,
	yellow = nil,
	orange = nil,
	red = nil,
	purple = nil,
	brown = nil,
	light = nil,
	dark = nil,
}

-- Update GTK settings by changing the options in the GTK group.
theme.gtk = {
	colors = {
		accent_color = colors.blue,
		accent_fg_color = foreground,
		accent_bg_color = colors.blue,
		window_fg_color = foreground,
		window_bg_color = background,
		view_fg_color = foreground,

		headerbar_fg_color = foreground,
		headerbar_bg_color = background,
		card_fg_color = foreground,
		card_bg_color = background,
		dialog_fg_color = foreground,
		dialog_bg_color = background,
		popover_fg_color = foreground,
		popover_bg_color = background,
		sidebar_fg_color = foreground,
		sidebar_bg_color = background,
		backdrop_fg_color = background,
		backdrop_bg_color = background,
	},

	-- GTK additionally allows themes to set 5 extra colors as theme palettes.
	-- That can be set using the `colorscheme` table. In this table, you can
	-- update colors on `scheme1` to `scheme5` to correspond to each of the five
	-- palettes. If left unset, they will not be present in the GTK stylesheet,
	-- and would not render. It is highly recommended to at least create one
	-- colorscheme. No default values exist for this attribute.
	palettes = {
		palette1 = gtk_defaultpalette,
		palette2 = gtk_defaultpalette,
		palette3 = gtk_defaultpalette,
		palette4 = gtk_defaultpalette,
		palette5 = gtk_defaultpalette,
	},

	-- This patch is necessary to ensure sidebars are also properly themed. Why
	-- is this not hardcoded? Freedom. Get the classic, broken look by setting
	-- this patch to an empty string.
	sidebar_patch = [[
.naviation-sidebar, .sidebar_pane, .top-bar {
  color: @sidebar_fg_color;
  background-color: @sidebar_bg_color;
}
.navigation-sidebar:backdrop, .sidebar_pane:backdrop, .top-bar:backdrop {
  color: @backdrop_fg_color;
  background-color: @backdrop_bg_color;
}
  ]],

	-- Want to customize your experience EVEN MORE? There's an option for that.
	extra_css = "",

	-- You can also customize the file the complied themes will be output to.
	-- You can include home-relative paths (~/) and they will be expanded.
	out = {
		gtk3 = "~/.config/gtk-3.0/gtk.css",
		gtk4 = "~/.config/gtk-4.0/gtk.css",
	},
}

-- Update Kitty options here. This application is only concerned with color
-- themes, and will not update other UI-related config like fonts, cursors,
-- opacity, etc.
theme.kitty = {
	colors = {
		background = background,
		foreground = foreground,
		black = colors.black,
		red = colors.red,
		green = colors.green,
		yellow = colors.yellow,
		blue = colors.blue,
		magenta = colors.magenta,
		cyan = colors.cyan,
		white = colors.white,
		bright_black = colors.black,
		bright_red = colors.red,
		bright_green = colors.green,
		bright_yellow = colors.yellow,
		bright_blue = colors.blue,
		bright_magenta = colors.magenta,
		bright_cyan = colors.cyan,
		bright_white = colors.white,
	},

	-- You can also customize the file the complied themes will be output to.
	-- You can include home-relative paths (~/) and they will be expanded.
	out = "~/.config/kitty/theme.conf",
}

-- Output the colors to a file in a way which can be used by other programs. You
-- have full control over the formatting of the file to ensure it is maximally
-- usable with your needs. Although, to establish a standard, a default format
-- is provided.
-- Be very aware, the handler for raw theme still doesn't exist as of v0.1.0.
-- No options within this table will work.
theme.raw = {
	-- You can define multiple tables for the raw handler, and each table can have
	-- its own attributes. All tables will be processed separately, and each table
	-- will be output to the specified output file following the specified
	-- formatting.
	spaced = {
		-- Of course, as usual, you can set and override colors as needed. All
		-- key-value pairs from the `colors` table will be output in the file
		-- following the right formating rules. No error-checking or type safety
		-- checks are done here, so you are on your own.
		colors = colors,

		-- This defines how each line will be formatted in the output file. Variables
		-- are defined by putting their names inside {}. For example, this format will
		-- result in the following output:
		-- white #ffffff
		-- black #000000
		-- Available variables are:
		-- {name}: Color name (no spaces allowed)
		-- {hexcode}: Hexadecimal color value (with leading hashtag)
		-- {hexvalue}: Hexadecimal color value (without leading hashtag)
		format = "{name} {hexcode}",

		-- You can also expand all environment variables available to the program
		-- like in the shell. Extra variables have also been added, including:
		-- $CACHEDIR: The cache directory for Chroma, usually `~/.cache/chroma`
        -- Okay, I lied. As of 0.1.0, you still can't use custom exports.
		out = "$CACHEDIR/colors.col",
	},
}

-- You need to return the theme table at the end. Without this, Chroma can't see
-- any theme data.
return theme
```

## Overrides

We can create themes, sure. But, what if I have my configuration files saved somewhere else? Or you want particular colors in GTK's palette 5? This is where the overrides come into play. All you need to do is create `~/.config/chroma/overrides.lua` and populate it with the overrides you want. Note that you need to reference the current theme to override its options. This override file, if existing, will make overrides to every loaded theme.

```lua
-- Note the different require clause to import current theme.
local theme = require("chroma.themes.current")

-- The override table is merged with the themes table. This ensures only the
-- overridden values are updated, and other values are untouched.
theme.kitty = {
    out = "~/.config/kitty/themes/" .. theme.meta.name .. '.conf'
}

-- Of course, we still need to return the theme so Chroma can read the theme data.
return theme
```

## Notes

I have been trying to inject the default theme table into lua's system path, so theme developers can get type hints. Applications like `vim` (kind of) do it, so it should be possible. I just can't figure out how to do it. If anyone does, you're welcome to contribute.
